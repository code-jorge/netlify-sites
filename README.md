## Mini-Sites

Collection of small sites, side projects, experiments and ideas

### Hobby sites

Over the past few years I've built a series of small sites to test out concepts, or to just play around.
Instead of having each in it's own repo, I've decided to put them all here.

| Site                                    | Description                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [gender-reveal](./gender-reveal/)       | Baby gender reveal           |
| [infinite-tabs](./infinite-tabs/)       | Opens infinite tabs          |
| [jellydonut](./jellydonut/)             | A jellydonut floating        |
| [nuck-chorris](./nuck-chorris/)         | Nuck Chorris, the legend     |
| [tensorflow-intro](./tensorflow-intro/) | Detect objects in the video  |
